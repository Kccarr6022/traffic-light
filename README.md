# Description
The following program consists of a programmed traffic light in AVR Assembly. Implementations include North/South timing as well as East/West timing to control trafic flow with a crosswalk button interrupt for the north lane, and DAY/NIGHT cycling with photo resistor interrupts.

#Features
Written in AVR Assembly
- LED Sequences for Day/Night cycles
- State control with photoresistor and conditional branching
- Vector interrupts for crosswalks
- Time delays
